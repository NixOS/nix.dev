### Licensing and attribution

When opening pull requests with your own contributions, you agree to licensing your work under [CC-BY-SA 4.0].
Before merging your work, you have to sign the [contributor agreement](cla/README.md).

Having a single legal entity hold non-exclusive copyright avoids disputes and ensures the material can be put to use more effectively, e.g. by eventually publishing it as a book.
You will still be considered co-author, as recorded by version history.

When adding material by third parties, make sure it has a matching license that permits this.
In that case, unambiguously state source, authors, and license.
Also [add the original author as co-author] to the respective change, so we can track authorship through version history.

Notify the authors *before* using their work.

## Notes

### GitHub heading anchors fails linkcheck

Due to a [Sphinx bug][linkcheck gh bug], linkcheck fails when it verifies the
existence of GitHub heading anchors on rendered Markdown documents.

Until the bug is resolved, add the `user-content-` prefix to GitHub links
containing heading anchors.

For example, instead of
`https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action#user-content-how-can-i-run-nixos-tests`,
use
`https://github.com/cachix/install-nix-action#user-content-how-can-i-run-nixos-tests`.
