# CODEOWNERS file
#
# This file is used to describe who owns what in this repository. This file does not
# replace `meta.maintainers` but is instead used for other things than derivations
# and modules, like documentation, package sets, and other assets.
#
# For documentation on this file, see https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# Mentioned users will get code review requests.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to actually get pinged, commit access is required.
# This also holds true for GitHub teams. Since almost none of our teams have write
# permissions, you need to list all members of the team with commit access individually.
