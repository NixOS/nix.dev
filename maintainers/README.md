# Nix documentation team

The Nix documentation team was formed to [flatten the infamous learning curve](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documentation-team-flattening-the-learning-curve/20003).

## Goals

- Ease learning, increase onboarding success and user retention
- Improve organisation of Nix knowledge
- Lead, guide, and support related community efforts

## Motivation

To improve the state of affairs with Nix onboarding and documentation, we have to tackle some big issues and work through many small ones:
implement structural changes after gathering the necessary social support;
fix numerous little problems and help people get their contributions merged.

It requires significant time or resources to do this consistently.
The team is built around that limitation, and therefore organized as a praxicracy:
You are in charge if and only if you get the work done.

The team’s reason to exist is to make that principle discoverable and reproducible by laying groundwork and setting examples.

## Members

Current members are listed on the GitHub team [`@NixOS/documentation-team`](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/documentation-team).

Ping [`@NixOS/documentation-reviewers`](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/documentation-reviewers) for documentation reviews.

## Responsibilities

- Triage issues and pull requests
- Curate the [GitHub project board]
- Invite new participants
- Schedule meetings
- Moderate and keep to the schedule
- Take and publish meeting notes

Team members are encouraged to become maintainers and take ownership of some piece of documentation they care about.
The team lead supports team members who want to take on [maintainer responsibilities](./responsibilities.md).

### Team lead

- Set a direction and agendas
- Represent the team
- Publish announcements and reports
- Exercise elevated privileges:
  - Manage permissions for the [GitHub team] and the [GitHub project board]

## Team meetings

The team holds weekly meetings on Mondays 16:00-17:00 and Thursdays 16:00-17:00 (Europe/Berlin):

### Meeting protocol

The purpose of the meetings is to
- make strategic decisions
- coordinate efforts
- share knowledge

As the Nix community is distributed globally, available time for synchronous communication is highly limited and therefore very valuable.
Writing is still the primary medium of communication.

To keep discussions highly focused and make their results discoverable and accessible, we will:

- Prepare meeting agendas in the [collaborative scratchpad]
  - Estimate and follow estimated discussion time for each agenda item
  - Pull requests have priority
  - Invite authors to the meetings if possible
- Take notes in a [collaborative scratchpad]
- Add notes to existing issues or pull requests as a comment and link them back to the meeting notes
- Merge pull requests made on the last session
- Submit new pull requests or issues
- Post the meeting notes on the [*Documentation* Discourse category]

[collaborative scratchpad]: https://pad.lassul.us/p-Y8MjU2SdSD5qO1fnpCPA?edit#

Meeting notes should contain:

- Date of meeting
- List of attendees
- Results and links to GitHub issues and pull requests for each agenda item
