# Nix documentation team

The Nix documentation team was formed to flatten the infamous learning curve.

## Goals

- ease learning, increase onboarding success and user retention
- improve organization of knowledge
- lead, guide, and support related community efforts

## Motivation

To improve the state of affairs with Nix onboarding and documentation, we have to tackle some big issues and work through many small ones:
implement structural changes after gathering the necessary social support;
fix numerous little problems and help people get their contributions merged.

It requires significant time or resources to do this consistently.
The team is built around that limitation, and therefore organized as a praxicracy:
you are in charge if and only if you get the work done.

The team’s reason to exist is to make that principle discoverable and reproducible by laying groundwork and setting examples.

### Meeting protocol

The purpose of the meetings is to
- make strategic decisions
- coordinate efforts
- exchange experience and insights.

As the Nix community is distributed globally, available time for synchronous communication is highly limited and therefore very valuable.
Writing is still the primary medium of communication.

To keep discussions highly focused and make their results accessible, we will:

- prepare meeting agendas as pull requests on the [nix.dev repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nix.dev)
  - pull requests have priority, invite authors to the meetings
  - annotate estimated discussion time for each agenda item, it should be followed
- prepare notes collaboratively in a [HedgeDoc scratchpad]
- merge pull requests made on the last session
- submit new pull requests or issues
- add notes to existing issues or pull requests as a comment
- post the meeting protocol on the [*Documentation* Discourse category]
- update calendar invitations

[HedgeDoc scratchpad]: https://pad.lassul.us/p-Y8MjU2SdSD5qO1fnpCPA?edit#

Meeting notes should contain:

- date of meeting
- list of attendees
- results and links to GitHub issues and pull requests for each agenda item
