# Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

In this tutorial, we'll show you **a few short steps** to get started using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as your continuous integration (CI) workflow for commits and pull requests.

## Caching builds using Cachix

One benefit of Nix is that **CI can build and cache developer environments for every project** on every branch using binary caches.

An important aspect of CI is the feedback loop of, **how many minutes does the build take to finish?**

Using [Cachix](https://cachix.org/) you'll never have to waste time building a derivation twice, and you'll share built derivations with all your developers.

After each job, just-built derivations are pushed to your binary cache.

Before each job, derivations to be built are first substituted (if they exist) from your binary cache.

### 1. Creating your first binary cache

It's recommended to have different binary caches per team, depending who will have write/read access to it.

Fill out the form on the [create binary cache](https://app.cachix.org/cache) page.

On your freshly created binary cache, follow the **Push binaries** tab instructions.

### 2. Setting up secrets

On your GitHub repository or organization (for use across all repositories):

1. Click on `Settings`.
2. Click on `Secrets`.
3. Add your previously generated secrets (`CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY` and/or `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN`).

## Setting up GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:

```yaml
name: "Test"
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v17
      with:
        nix_path: nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable
    - uses: cachix/cachix-action@v11
      with:
        name: mycache
        # If you chose signing key for write access
        signingKey: '${{ secrets.CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY }}'
        # If you chose API tokens for write access OR if you have a private cache
        authToken: '${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}'
    - run: nix-build
    - run: nix-shell --run "echo OK"
```

Once you commit and push to your GitHub repository,
you should see status checks appearing on commits and PRs.
