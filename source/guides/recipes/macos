# Nix(OS) development on macOS

Over the recent years, the Nix(OS) community have made great strides in adding support for macOS. Today, it is possible to use Macs for comfortable Nix(OS) development. 

# Nix on macOS

First, you need to install Nix on your macOS. Using the [Official Installer](https://nixos.org/download) is a good start. If you need help, follow https://nixcademy.com/posts/nix-on-macos/.
