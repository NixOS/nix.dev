# Packaging

In these tutorials, you will package existing software for use within the Nix ecosystem and learn how to contribute them to [Nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages): a vast library of software packaged for use with Nix, by a community of users like yourself. You will also learn how Nix simplifies and automates the process of reliably building a family of artifacts for use across different execution platforms.
