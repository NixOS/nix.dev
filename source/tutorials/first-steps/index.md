# First steps

This tutorial series is where you should start learning Nix.

In these lessons, you will use basic Nix commands to obtain almost any piece of software, create development environments on the fly, and learn how to make reproducible scripts.
You will also learn reading the Nix language, and later use it to build portable, reproducible development environments.
