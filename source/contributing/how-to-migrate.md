# Migrating Documentation

Migrating documentation is often crucial when reorganizing any project. As such, below is a list of instructions and guidelines to aid you when embarking on the migration journey.

## Licensing
   1. Familiarize yourself with the licenses governing the documentation you intend to migrate.
   2. Verify that the license of the documentation is compatible with this project's current license.
   3. If the licenses align, proceed with the migration. Otherwise, follow the steps 4 through 7.
   4. Identify the file and determine all contributors to the documentation (typically using git blame or a co-owners document).
   5. Contact all contributors, publicly requesting permission to migrate the document to the new license (via issue or pull request). 
   6. Await responses from all recipients and obtain explicit approval from each contributor before proceeding.
   7. If agreement from all contributors cannot be obtained, consider alternative solutions to avoid licensing conflicts such as:
        - A full rewrite of the document.
        - Rewriting the areas of specific contributors who did not reply or approve.

## Documentation Assessment
   1. Perform a thorough review of the existing documentation to check for preexisting information.
   2. Consider factors such as:
      - **Scope:** Is the topic covered too broad or narrow to be useful?
      - **Relevance:** Is this information applicable to what this project is trying to accomplish?
      - **Completeness:** If any, what gaps are existing in this information? 
      - **Accuracy:** If incorrect, is it easy enough to fix or does it warrant a full rewrite?
      - **Organization:** How self apparent is the structure of the document, and does it align with the organization of this projects documents?
      - **Readability:** How clear is the information when presented to a new reader? 
   3. Be sure to identify the type of document that it is easily classifiable as one of the following:
      - Reference 
      - Concept
      - Tutorial
      - Recipe 
   4. If it does not properly classify under step 3 then one will need to consider the following options:
      - Rewrite the document to conform to one of the aforementioned types.
      - Split up the document into individual components that can be categorized correctly.
      - Abandoning the work entirely if it's not feasible.

## Version Control Consideration
   Determine the appropriate branch in the repository that contains the most up-to-date or relevant information about the project. This is often assumed to be main or master, yet it can be located in other branches such as beta, next, etc. 

## Visual Quality Assurance
   1. Please ensure that the table of contents is structured correctly on the actual site and navigates as expected.
   2. Check the following aspects to function or render as intended:
      - Headings
      - Sections
      - Code Formatting
      - Tables
      - links
      - Images and Diagrams
