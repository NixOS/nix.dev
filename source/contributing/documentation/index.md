## Feedback

Feedback is also a valuable contribution.
Please share your thoughts in the [Documentation category on Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/documentation/25).

### Nix beginners

Try to use official documentation as your primary resource, however incomplete it may appear.

Please open issues and report all problems or questions that arise.
Also state your learning goals and the paths you have taken so far.

Sharing your first-hand experience will help guide our efforts and solve recurrent problems with documentation for you and everyone else.

### Nix educators

You will probably have observed where learners get stuck most often, and which typical needs and questions they have.
You may have your own written notes for classes, trainings, or presentations.

Please share your experience to help us improve upstream documentation and beginner materials, so you can focus on providing the best value to your students.

### Domain experts using Nix

If you are proficient in applying Nix to a domain-specific problem, and want to share your expertise on best practices, please check the existing content.
- Does existing material on your subject meet your standards?
- How could we improve it?
- Is there a popular application of Nix' capabilities not yet covered?
- We would be glad to incorporate your insights.
