A guide for how-to guides?

Yes!
How-to guides form a crucial part of teaching people what a technology does and how to do it correctly and safely.

We define *how-to guides* using the [Diátaxis framework for technical documentation](https://diataxis.fr/).

Especially note [the difference between tutorials and how-to guides](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/).

> A how-to guide is concerned with work - a task or problem, with a practical goal.

Sharing modern software abounds in practical problems.
nix offers wonderful primitives to solve some of these problems.
