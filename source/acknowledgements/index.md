## History

Many thanks to past contributors, who helped make Nix documentation what it is today:

- [@infinisil] helped lead the team between 2022-11 and 2024-05.
  During that time he provided diligent technical reviews of countless contributions, reworked the [contribution guides for Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and rewrote his [module system tutorial](https://nix.dev/tutorials/module-system/deep-dive) for publication.

- [@olafklingt](https://github.com/olafklingt) volunteered on the team from 2022-10 to 2024-05, and was a formal member between 2022-10 and 2024-05.
  He added an [introduction to NixOS virtual machines](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/nixos-configuration-on-vm) and greatly simplified the [tutorial on NixOS VM tests](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/integration-testing-using-virtual-machines), and kept them up to date.
  Both articles enjoy great popularity and are central elements of our tutorial series.

- [@brianmcgee](https://github.com/brianmcgee) was part of the team from 2023-03 to 2023-10 and contributed to the Learning Journey Working Group effort.

- [@zmitchell] led the [Learning Journey Working Group](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=learning%20journey%20working%20group%20-%20meeting%20notes%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest_topic) from 2023-03 to 2023-08 that added a number of tutorials.
  He published [regular updates on developments in documentation](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=This%20Month%20in%20Nix%20Docs%20in%3Atitle%20before%3A2023-10-30%20order%3Alatest_topic) in that period.

- [@Mic92](https://github.com/Mic92) was a founding member and part of the team from 2022-05 to 2023-01.
  Jörg had written a great deal of documentation on the NixOS Wiki, and shared his experience to set a direction for the documentation team.

- [@domenkozar](https://github.com/domenkozar) was a founding member and part of the team from 2022-05 to 2023-01.
  Domen originally started nix.dev, wrote many basic tutorials, and funded editorial work through [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/).
  He helped bootstrap the documentation team, handed out permissions, and advised us on many aspects.
  Domen donated nix.dev to the NixOS Foundation in 2023-07.
