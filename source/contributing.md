## Contribute to documentation

Documentation on the Nix ecosystem is divided into several domains based on purpose.

The manuals for [Nix][nix manual], [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs manual], and [NixOS][nixos manual] 
are reference documentation, specifying interfaces and behavior.

[nix.dev] is a curated repository of guides and tutorials aimed
to teach beginners essential Nix knowledge, show best practices, and help orient
users in the Nix ecosystem.

[Guidelines for contributing to documentation] are available in the nix.dev repository.

A [detailed overview of the entire Nix documentation ecosystem] is available
in the Nix documentation team repository.

## Contribute to Nixpkgs

Packaging for Nix is simple when you have understood the basic concept.

[The Nixpkgs manual][nixpkgs quick-start] explains step-by-step how to add new packages to
the Nix package collection. There are also [programming language specific instructions].

You can find inspiration for things to improve in the [reported issues][nixpkgs issues].

## Contribute to NixOS

Itâ€™s pretty easy to contribute to NixOS compared to other linux
distributions. All the code is on GitHub in the repository [nixpkgs].
Everyone can propose an improvement and most of them get merged after a
review of the maintainers. You will get feedback in the pull request.

See the [NixOS manual][nixos manual dev] to get started and find all the details.

You can find inspiration for things to improve in the [reported issues][nixos issues].

There are also [issues tagged with good-first-bug] that are a good start for new
contributors.
